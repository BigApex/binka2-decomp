# BinkA2 Rust wrapper/decomp/dumper playground

## FAQ

### It says `failed to load binkawin64.dll!` when I try to use it!

Contact your local dealer for that sweet dank stuff we call `binkawin64.dll` with the sweet bonus package of a nice 64 pack hash of `90AC48BA1D8CB0C1`.

### It produces wrong output!

gitgud (C) Kranky's advice.

In reality only retail Apex implementation works, but it has a few hardcoded offsets due to the nature of the streaming file.
I eventually need to refactor this into a library for streaming files (and banks cause required data is there?)
